                                has a 5 year old daughter. He
                                has struggled in the not so distant past, but is coming around to himself again. He is a

                                charisma are the qualities most people see in him, his artwork is pretty damn awesome.
                                He has contributed to a few major comic book labels and some independent graphic novels.
                                He just got engaged to his long time girlfriend. Logan brings a smile for everyone

                            <p>Hunter and I met in college through Jen, my wife, and we share a lot of the same views on
                                life. That being said... our lives are not the same. Hunter gained about 50lbs of muscle
                                in the past 2 years and went from being a couch potato to placing in Spartan Races
                                around the country.
                                He just recently opened up his own personal fitness program that he runs out of his
                                house. He doesn't know it yet, but he will probably be a guinea pig for my software
                                development journey.
